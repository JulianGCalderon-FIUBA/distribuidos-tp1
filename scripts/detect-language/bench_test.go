	"Dota 2, where do I start. This game has ruined my social life, I spend every day on this game, training, waiting, and drinking through my mountain dew, to one day become the greatest.

My dad dropped to the ground in tears, screaming at the all mighty gabe newell, begging for his son back, but it was too late, I was already back on dota, at mid, blaming my team for sucking  This game is why I wake up, Why I masturbate, why I decide that masturbating while playing is a good idea.

	"'THE PUB SUPPORT'   'Where are wards?' The pub Carry demanded.   'I placed them and they were countered' the Support began, 'I am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm, protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more, also possibly sentries to remove their-'   'UP COUR PLS' the mid hero politely added.  'Give Savle' The Carry demanded. 'Certainly.' replies the support, using the salve on the Carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave.   'So where is mek?' the Carry said, after he was ganked due to overextending. The Support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse.  'Again, having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards, I don't think a 7 minute Mek is viable.' The Support replies. 'Haha look your level, so low, noob' the Carry retorted. 'U have no item xaxa'.  'Well, jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which I attempted to give you, the carry, the priority over.'  The Carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower, oblivious to the enemy tp that the Support moved away from.  'Report Support, usless' The carry cried in allchat, in between mentioning various aspects of the Support's Mother's anatomy.  'Instead of reporting and acting like that, why don't you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry?' the Support asked, as he watched the Carry return to afk-lasthitting lane creeps.  'HAH, support is for noskill noobs like you!'",

	"  The Real Dota 2      Dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played     both professionally and casually    incompetently by millions of enslaved     passionate fans    Russians worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred     heroes    carries, forming two teams of     five players    five feeders. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts     to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare    raging in an unknown language and teamfighting with one RAMPAGE victor.  Irresistibly     colorful on the surface    addictive, Dota is a game     of infinite depth and complexity    which requires, no, infact takes an infinite amount of your life away. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities     that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike    that allow players to screw with their allies and get their teams killed. This is one of the reasons that     the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow    Dota will have more rage quitting and all chat abuse than any other game. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive     audience    Russia, so that the rest of the world can     experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can provide    learn from these ingenious people and become inspired to spread their knowledge with the rest of the world.

	"DotA 2 Will drain you of your will to keep playing, and yet you will always return. DotA 2 Will make you regret ever playing it, and yet you will always think 'Just one more game' DotA 2 Will take away all your free time, and yet you'll almost feel proud of how many hours you have in DotA 2.  With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2.   But you won't. You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you.  If you start playing this game, you  will  become addicted. You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too.   tl;dr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others. You will become an angry person.  Basically 10/10 GOTY All years",

	"Alright, listen up. Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core.  In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally, though, you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity.  Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time.  Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and 'tryhardish.' Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't 'hate free.' I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more 'tryhard.' Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the 'this is ranked, you better be a damn good player' mentality.  But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself and that's why I keep going back to it. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things, it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being 'OP') and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero 'pay to win' elements in the game.  It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. To put it roughly in perspective: Playing Dota 2 is like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a 'fooping idiot' every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? 'Uninstall Skyrim, noob.' Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? 'Learn to play, tard.' It would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures, would it not? Sadly that's how Dota 2's community is.   Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine), which is 50% of the time (and sometimes not even when you're winning). It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. Often your day will just be worse after playing Dota 2, instead of it cheering you up as games do. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price.  Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're good to go. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting 'a stick in the mud' player on your team.  Great game with bad community.",

I lost too much things on my life most of them are privacy/personal things not going to write them down but one of them is my education 24 years old still studying engineering because of this game. If you are going to say that you can manage your day between playing 'DOTA' and studying or working you are wrong because the average match time is 35 min *only 1 match. So 35 min × 3 games per day = 105 min. Not mentioning that some games exceed 1 hour if both teams played well. Please take this as an advice from 24 years old guy who has been suffering for 3 years because of this game I sucked on education you can be better than me and quit, I destroyed my dream and now im trying to bring it back wish me good luck.  Please this is not a 'joke post' and this advice aiming on teenagers who want to achieve their future dreams just don't play this game its ♥♥♥♥in AWESOME game but you have to pay your life for it.  Your choice life or Dota and this is not a joke if you throw my words away just please save my comment on your favorites and come back after 3 years don't cry if your life got ruined.

	"Dota 2 is the official sequel to the highly popular mod for Blizzard's Warcraft III, Defense of the Ancients. A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valve's favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before.  Dota 2 is a real-time strategy game in the sub-genre called MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). A genre that has grown rapidly the past few years, with different type of alterations in favor of success. Dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular MOBA, right behind the giant League of Legends. Just like LoL, Dota 2 is gaining success throughout it's competetive e-sport scene, and it's clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. The latest and biggest tournament was The International 2013, which included a total prize pool of over 2.8 million US dollars, which was the biggest prize pool in e-sport history.  Gameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master. The map consists of 3 lanes that are constantly being pushed by NPC creeps. You are controlling a hero amongst 4 other in your team, and are fighting against 5 in the opposing team. The goal is to push your heroes and NPC creeps to the enemy base, where you have to destroy the ancient. It sounds pretty easy, but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics, the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics. Plus the over 100 heroes you get to play and face.  After 300 hours I have only touched what I call the more advanced mechanics, and I am not even close to professional level. The most experienced players have around 5000 hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past 3 years to Dota 2. Since the game is Extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play. These type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players. There is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there, beware though - the tutorial does not cover any Russian.  Dota 2 might be competetive, extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap, but it is still the game that I have spend the most time playing on Steam (mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it). Somehow I keep returning to it, so I suppose I am enjoying it. You better have people to play with though, and you better not be good friends - because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe it's ♥♥♥ with it until you hate each other.   Only play this if you plan on getting some mental disorder. Time will fly, and you will realize you still suck and people hate you no matter what. It's free so why do you need a review anyway?   Translations:  German ",
	"I originally played Dota when it was merely a UMS on WC3, so take this review for what it's worth.   Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading.  This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game. If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with.  So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game:  Pros -This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing.  -Free to play with optional cosmetic costs.  -Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously.  -Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer.  -Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game.  Cons -This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA.  -Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of 'fundamentals of gameplay' video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay.   -Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server.   -Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions.  -There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier.   This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy.   Final Rating:  -Game 9/10 -Game community 3/10",

	"I've always wanted to go to Russia. To learn the culture, eat and drink and see the sights. But I cannot do that, as it is expensive and I'm busy doing my uni work.  But then I found Dota 2. This free learning course teaches you all about Russians and their culture. I can even speak decent Russian! However, these Russian people can get quite angry and annoying. They often shout the phrase '♥♥♥♥' and bring you to the depths of insanity. I got forced to drink my sorrows away during the beginning of the course, but it was worth it in the end.  If you don't have the time and money to travel to Russia, I'd suggest you pick up Dota 2. A fantastic learning resource.  8/10",

	"I have played Dota 2 for a little over three years now, so I think I am finally ready to give it an in depth review. I gave this game a review back in 2013, but I am going to change that. First of all, I'm going to start by listing off what I like about the game.  ::THE PROS::  1) Dota 2 is, obviously, a team game. Playing this game with friends is a really fun experience and can act as a source of really fantastic memories. My point is, if you play this game with a group of four other friends, Dota 2 is probably one of the best options out there.  2) Dota 2 has a fantastic tutorial system and the game is very well designed to accomodate new players. A new player can go from a full AI game to an AI game with 4 other random people to playing a 5v5 online; the transition is really smooth.  3) I have played both League and Dota, and I can honestly say that I think that Dota 2 is much more visually pleasing to look at. A smooth, clean UI makes the game easier on the eyes compared to League's cartoon-y design (which suits some, but not me).  4) Dota has an extremely vast pool of heroes that can be played to suit almost anyone's playstyle. After you play Dota for awhile, you can pick out the heroes that really fit your playstyle and excel at them through ranked matchmaking. It's damn near impossible to be bad at literally every hero. The large hero pool (100+) allows for THOUSANDS of different lineup possibilities, meaning every game has the chance to be completely new and different than anything you've played before.  5) Honestly, Dota 2 is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. No; it is THE most addicting game I have ever played. As a full-time student, I still have managed to rack up 2,500 hours in this game in my free-time. Especially back when I was a new player, I played this game all the time.  However. I am actually changing my review of this game from positive to negative. Let me tell you why.  ::THE CONS::  1) Here's my biggest flaw with the game. I absolutely hate -- I MEAN HATE -- Valve's regional matchmaking. Before finding a match, the player is supposed to change server preferences to the closest server(s) to the members of the party, and they are supposed to choose the appropriate language preference. For example, as an American player, it is expected that you choose U.S. West and U.S. East as your servers, with English as your language preference. And, generally, Americans follow this rule. HOWEVER. In almost every game I play now, I get a Peruvian or Brazilian or someone from South East Asia in my games. Hopefully it makes sense to the readers of this review that you should not be finding a match in the United States if you live in Asia. You lag, and become actually useless in the game. The South Americans, though, spam in their native languages and constantly flame. Am I generalizing? Honestly, no. I'm really not. If you are good at Dota 2, you would and should queue for games for which you are prepared to play at your best. Valve has no form of region lock on matchmaking (they really can't, due to international professional teams), and while it's really not Valve's fault, I just wish there was some way to reliably play with four people from your country and/or language. This is seriously Dota 2's biggest flaw, because so much of every game revolves around the synergy and cooperation among teammates. This is literally impossible when someone spends the entire game flaming you in a different language. I'm honestly not trying to be discriminatory in any way; this is just how Dota is in reality and is likely never to change. I have become so fed up with this poor form of matchmaking that I have actually, finally, uninstalled the game.  2) Dota has actually no reliable way to punish feeders. Sure, you and your team can use the report system (you only have a limited number of reports by the way, so after you expend them on flamers or feeders you are out of luck and have to enlist the other team and your teammates to waste their reports on the other feeders and flamers). The feeder may get put in low priority, but it honestly teaches them nothing. We have all been in low prio at one point or another, and we come out unchanged. Valve needs to implement a way to correct this. I'm not alone in my view on this either. Even professional player Secret.Puppey voiced his opinion the other day, which is very similar to mine. Punishments need to become more severe.  3) The Dota 2 community is actually cancerous. If you are not playing in a 5-stack of friends, I can almost promise you that you will very rarely, if ever, get on a team where all 5 teammates are willing to cooperate and play as a coordinated team. Almost every single game, someone on your team will flame someone else for sucking really bad, mostly because they probably did. But people speak so hatefully towards one another that it really feels like an unwelcoming scene. One of the professional Dota casters (joinDota's 'Capitalist') tweeted the other day that he loses so much respect for pro players in pubs because they spend so much time flaming and tilting. This is actually about 90% of the Dota community, actually, not just the professionals. Everyone has this weird god complex where they are convinced they are better than everyone on the server, even if they got no kills and fed unimaginably badly.  4) This kind of ties in with the points I have made previously. It is almost impossible to single-handedly win a game if your team is playing very poorly. Thus, the entire game comes down to teamwork; and most Dota players are unreliable teammates who will either feed or flame (90%, roughly, like I said). The 10% of people who don't flame are the people who are actually in professional teams (and while they flame in pubs, they synergize well in their professional settings (unless you are kuro and rtz)).  5) Dota is really bad for your health unless you have a godly amount of self control. If you win a game, you can end happy. But if you lose a game, you keep playing and keep losing and it becomes very depressing and frustrating. The garbage community gets in your head, and it's just bad.  Look, honestly, I fully expect to continue to follow the professional Dota scene. Dota really is one of the best games out there and it's especially fun to watch the pros play. But, if you are looking for a MOBA that you can regularly enjoy, then you are better off playing StarCraft II, which is where I am headed now. Don't get me wrong, though; Dota 2 is still much better than League of Legends and I would never suggest League of Legends to anyone unless they are really, really struggling with Dota 2. I won't be returning to Dota until Valve makes some much needed changes to the game, or at least until I have had a long, much-needed break from the seriously draining community that Dota offers.  TL;DR: It's a good MOBA, better than LoL, but too many community &amp; matchmaking issues to make this worth a positive. Gave me a great 3 years of entertainment though. Play SCII.  Rating: 7/10 Good game, for awhile. But community is horrible.",
